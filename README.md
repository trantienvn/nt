# node-snapdrop [![CodeQL](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

Just the original [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/Snapdrop), with complete Node.js server.

> **Warning**\
> Due to [Heroku Free Plan Shutdown](https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop/issues/15), node-snapdrop server has changed and can now be reached [here](https://node-snapdrop.onrender.com).\
> Old server will be kept (without any code update) until November 28, 2022, then it will be shutdown by Heroku.

## Getting started

To get started, clone and cd the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bellisario/node-snapdrop.git && cd node-snapdrop
```

Install all dependencies with NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server with:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Public Run

If you want to run in your public "sharable" IP instead of locally, you can use this command:

```bash
node index.js public
```

> Remember to check your IP Address using your OS command to see where you can access the server.
